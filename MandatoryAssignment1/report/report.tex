\section*{Computing the potential and the added mass coefficients along a\\ circle, an ellipse and a square}

The python function "Ellipse\_Circle" presented in this report solves the following integral equation(eq.:(\ref{eq:1})) along an ellipse with major half axis $a_0$ and minor half axis $b_0$ or a circle when $a=b$, while another python function called "Square", does the exact same calculations along a square.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
-\pi \phi_n + \sum_{m=1}^N \phi_m \int_{S_m} \frac{\dd}{\dd n} log r dS = \sum_{m=1}^N \big[ \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} \big]_i h_{n,m, \quad n=1,2,...,N}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{align}\label{eq:2}
\frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial n} &= n_i \nonumber \\
h_{n,m} &= \int_{S_m} log r dS \nonumber \\
&\approx \frac{1}{2} [\log((x_m^{(1)} - \bar{x}_n)^2 + (y_m^{(1)} - \bar{y}_n)^2) + \log((x_m^{(2)} - \bar{x}_n)^2 + (y_m^{(2)} - \bar{y}_n)^2)] (\frac{1}{2} \Delta S_m)
\end{align}

To obtain a numerical solution for the equations above, we need to discretize the body surface $S$ by a number of smaller surface-segments $S_N$. 
For the circle and the ellipse, this was done by dividing the angle $2\pi$ at the center of the circle or the ellipse by a number $N$, and thus dividing the circle into $N$ segments, we will then get the x and y position of the starting/ending points of the segments on the body surface $S$.\\ 
For the case with the square , the discretization is done by starting at a point $(-a,-a)$ and then moving in the x direction by adding small increments to the point we started from, while y is constant. when we reach the point $(a,-a)$, we move upwards towards the point $(a,a)$ while we keep x constant, and we keep going counter clockwise until we reach the point where we started from. For the increments for each step I have chosen $a(1-\cos(\frac{\pi}{Ni}))$ which gives more dense discretization points in the corners of the square. All the four sides of the square are divided into the same amount of segments.\\ 
Following plots show how the surface for an ellipse, circle and a square is discretized by dividing the whole body surface into $N$ smaller segments, $S_N$.

\end{subfigure}

\caption{Discretization of surfaces with different shapes using $N=20$ segments. }
\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

The $(x,y)$ points, shown by small circles on the surfaces in figure:(\ref{fig:1}), are then the end/start points of the segments. The discrete equation:(\ref{eq:1}) may be satisfied in the centroid of each segment at $(\bar{x}_i, \bar{y}_i) = (\frac{1}{2}(x_{i-1} + x_i),\frac{1}{2}(y_{i-1}+y_i))$. These points are marked with stars on figure:(\ref{fig:1}).\\

The length of each segment $dS$ is then  approximated by a straight line from a point on the surface to the next one. This length is then used to obtain an approximation for the unit normal vectors on the body surface, and as we can see from equation:(\ref{eq:2}) it will also be used to obtain an approximation for the integral $\int_{S_m} log r dS$.\\

For the unit normal vectors we have the following expressions:\\
\begin{equation*}
n_1 = -\frac{dy}{dS} \quad , \quad n_2 = \frac{dx}{dS} \quad , \quad n_6 = \textbf{r} \times \textbf{n} = x n_2 - y n_1
\end{equation*}
$\textbf{n}= (n_1, n_2)$ is the normal vector on segment $S_m$, pointing out of the fluid. The flux integral $\int_{S_m} (\frac{\dd}{\dd n}) log r dS$ equals the negative(since the normal is pointing into the geometry) of the opening angle $-\Delta \Theta_{n,m}$, defined by the segment $S_m$, such that equation:(\ref{eq:1}) can be expressed in the following discrete form: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
-\pi \phi_n + \sum_{m=1}^N \phi_m(\Delta \Theta_{n,m})=\sum_{m=1}^N \big[ \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} \big]_i h_{n,m, \quad n=1,2,...,N}
\end{equation}

Where $\frac{\dd \phi_i}{\dd n}$ equals $n_i$ on the surface $S$ and then equation:(\ref{eq:2}) is evaluated by the use of 2-point Gaussian quadrature rule. We can now solve equation:(\ref{eq:3}), by simply solving the equation $A \phi = B$, where A is a matrix of all the values for the opening angles on the left hand side of equation:(\ref{eq:3}). We can find these angles by using the law of cosines which is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem. We will have $- \pi$ on the diagonal of the $A$ matrix. We can clearly see from figure:(\ref{fig:1a}) that when $n=m$ we have only a straight line and thus the angle must be equal to $\pi$. The right hand side of equation:(\ref{eq:3}) equals vector B.\\ 
Obtaining a solution for the potential $\phi$ will then help us with finding the added mass coefficients which are calculated by the following approximation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
m_{ji} = \rho \int_S \phi_j n_i dS \approx \rho \sum_{m=1}^N [\phi_j]_m [n_i]_m \Delta S_m
\end{equation}

For cases of flow around objects, we need to consider the additional effect resulting from the fluid acting on the object. These forces or effects represented by the added mass coefficients, can also arise in a direction due to motion in a different direction . Also the added mass depends not only on the geometry of the body but also on the direction of the acceleration. In a physical sense we can think of these added mass coefficients as a weight added to a motion system due to the fact that an accelerating or decelerating body moves some volume of the surrounding fluid with it as it moves, and the added mass force will then oppose the motion.\\[1em] 

When we look at a two dimensional body, we identify three degrees of freedom, since a degree of freedom represents the freedom to move in an independent way, then a two dimensional body can have a linear motion in the lateral and the longitudinal direction, but also a rotational motion. When we consider the added mass coefficients  $m_{ij}$ along such body, we can think of each component as the mass associated with a force on the object moving in the fluid in the $i^{th}$ direction due to a unit acceleration in the $j^{th}$ direction. When considering a two dimensional body the indexes \textit{i} and \textit{j} can have values 1, 2 and 6 and the added mass coefficients will then form a $3 \times 3$ matrix. Also the added mass is a pressure force per unit acceleration acting on a body, due to the acceleration field set up in the surrounding fluid. It is different in different degrees of motion and depends upon the  geometry of the body.\\[1em]

For symmetric geometries such as the geometries discussed in this assignment, the added mass tensor simplifies significantly. In the case of a circle as well as a square the lateral and longitudinal motion yields similar geometry and thus $m_{11} = m_{22}$, and also in the case of a circle the rotational added mass coefficient $m_{66}$  will be equal to zero.

As we can see from table:(\ref{tab:1}), the error is very small even with small number of segments and it goes towards zero as N increases. \\
Figure:(\ref{fig:2}) shows that as the resolution improves, we will have convergence of the numerical solution for $\phi_1$ to the analytical solution for the potential for a circle with radius $R_0$ performing a translation in the x or y-direction. For $N=1000$ the two graphs coincide completely. \\

The numerical results are than compared to the analytical results.\\[2em]

\newpage 

The analytical results for the added mass coefficients along an ellipse are as follows:
\begin{align*}
m_{11} = \rho \pi b_0^2 \quad , \quad m_{22} = \rho \pi a_0^2 \quad , \quad m_{66} = \frac{1}{8} \rho \pi (a_0^2 - b_0^2)^2
\end{align*}

These exact values for the added mass coefficients are used to investigate the convergence for the computed values in figure:(\ref{fig:4}).

\begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth}

\end{figure}
 
Figure:(\ref{fig:4}) show the ratio of the computed added mass coefficients divided by the corresponding analytical ones. We can see that this ratio converges towards 1 as $\frac{1}{N}$ tends to zero, but as we can see we get good convergence in $m_{11}$ and $m_{22}$ even with small numbers for $N$, so the convergence occurs much faster than for $m_{66}$ and as we can see, we get the best approximation when we have motion in the x-direction. Therefore I think it would be a good idea to investigate the error between the exact and the numerical solutions more closely. Specially in the case where $\frac{b_0}{a_0} = 0.1$.

As we can see from table:(\ref{tab:2}), the difference between the exact and the numerical value for the rotational added mass $m_{66}$ for an ellipse with the major half axis ten times longer than the minor half axis, is a bit too large, even though it will also converge towards the exact solution as N increases.\\[1em]

For a closer investigation of the error for the added mass coefficients along an ellipse where $\frac{b_0}{a_0}=0.1$, I made a plot of the error for the longitudinal, lateral and rotational added mass coefficients (figure:(\ref{fig:5})). It seems that for small values for $N$ the numerical value for $m_{66}$ is much smaller than the exact one and by doubling the number of $N$ values, we get half the error.  It seems that this error is directly related to the discretization of the body and the fact that the rotational and the lateral added mass along an ellipse with the major half axis 10 times larger than the minor half axis have larger values compared to the longitudinal one, but I was not able to figure out a good fix to this error issue.

\section*{Implementation for the case with a square}
The exact longitudinal, lateral and rotational added mass coefficients along a square are:

\begin{equation*}
m_{11} = m_{22} = 4.754 \rho a_0^2 \quad , \quad m_{66} = 0.725 \rho a_0^4
\end{equation*}

Following python code solves equation (\ref{eq:1}) and (\ref{eq:3}) for the potential and the added mass coefficients along a square with side lenghts of $2a_0$.

As we can see from the output of the code used to compute the potential and the added mass coefficients, the lateral and the longitudinal added masses are equal as expected.\\[1em]

\end{figure}

Figure:(\ref{fig:6}) shows convergence of the computed values for $m_{11}$ and $m_{66}$ as the resolution improves, also as $\frac{1}{N}$ tends to zero. We can also see the convergence from table:(\ref{tab:3}), where we can see that the error between the exact and the approximated values for the added masses decrease as N increases.\\
